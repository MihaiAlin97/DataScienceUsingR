# Data analysys using R - Part 4
## Solve the following problems
1. Simulate 1000 realizations of a standard normal random variable Z,
and use your simulated sample to estimate<br>
**(a)** P(Z > 2.5);<br>
**(b)** P(0 < Z < 1.645);<br>
**(c)** P(1.2 < Z < 1.45);<br>
**(d)** P(−1.2 < Z < 1.3).<br>
Compare with the theoretical values.

2. A ***X<sup>2</sup>*** random variable on n degrees of freedom has the same
distribution as the sum of n independent standard normal random
variables squared. Simulate a ***X<sup>2</sup>*** random variable on eight degrees of
freedom, and estimate its mean and variance. (Compare with the
theoretical values: 8, 16.)


3. Use the data set ***iris*** to compute:<br>
**(a)** mean, median, mode for ”Petal.Length”<br>
**(b)** range, variance, standard deviation, IQR for ”Sepal.Length” for the
species ”setosa”<br>
**(c)** kurtosis, skewness for ”Petal.Width”; is the distribution symmetric and
mesokurtic?

4. Construct the histogram of the variable ***Petal.Length*** in ***iris***, then
change the bins in an appropriate manner. Add the density function
to the graph. Construct the boxplot of a variable of your choice with
respect to each species.
